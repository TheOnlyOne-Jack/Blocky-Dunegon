# Blocky-Dunegon
We made Blocky Dungeons to practice our Unity and game design skills. Blocky Dungeons is a dungeon crawler game with some puzzle elements. It’s inspired by Soul Knight and Minecraft, for their game style and visuals. We are passionate about this game because this is the first official game we’ve made and will present to the public. For the future, we would like to implement more dungeons with new enemies and probably more game mechanics other than shooting and collecting stuff. We’ll also look at improving the visuals of the game to bring more immersion into the player’s experience.
